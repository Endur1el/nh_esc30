- ESC buildings now follow more consistent rules on being allowed for construction:
    - Special resource production buildings require either buildings or weapons to be allowed.
    - Other buildings require buildings to be allowed.
- Added minor partial overwrite to economic_categories to enable certain megastructure modifiers. Should not cause any compatibility issues.
- Added test event that gives player's country all ESC technologies and their vanilla prerequisites. Type 'event esc_test.1' into console to execute it.
