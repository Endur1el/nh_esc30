- ESC buildings now follow more consistent rules on being allowed for construction:
    - Special resource production buildings require either buildings or weapons to be allowed.
    - Other buildings require buildings to be allowed.
- Added minor partial overwrite to economic_categories to enable certain megastructure modifiers. Should not cause any compatibility issues.
- Added test event that gives player's country all ESC technologies and their vanilla prerequisites. Type 'event esc_test.1' into console to execute it.

>>> 21.01.2020
- Fixed missing minor artifacts from the resource UI if Universal Resource Patch is not used.
- Time-Space Continuum Manipulation technology no longer affects build costs. It now affects only construction speeds and decision enactment speed [new].
- Fixed a couple of small errors in localization strings.
- Added proper Polish translation by GhostOfForests (armor, buildings and job descriptions).

>>> 02.02.2020
- Fixed tier 6 thrusters having incorrect speed modifier for NSC ships.
- Getting either of the three vanilla dark matter technologies will now give an option for the remaning two (added dark matter thrusters to the list).
- ESC control menu is now restricted to single-player mode. Sorry - giving everyone free access to in multiplayer is just asking for abuse.
- Time-Dilation Chambers now grants leaders +25% experience gain (up from +10%) and gives ships +100 starting experience.
